# Speedometer
A simple speedometer made originally by [FivemTools](https://github.com/FivemTools/ftc_speedometer), edited by [Plactrix](https://github.com/Plactrix/ftc_speedometer)!

## Disclaimer
This is using a lot of part from the old ft_speedometer, so everything isn't coded by me.

## Dependancies
